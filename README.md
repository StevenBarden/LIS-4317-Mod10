# LIS-4317-Mod-10-Code
## What This Is
# This is a school project for my class.
# It uses R to make pictures of data.
# The data is about hot dog contests and jobs in the USA.
# I made it to learn about graphs and time.
## How to Use It
# 1. You need R on your computer.
# 2. Get the file called `LIS-4317-Mod-10-Code.R`.
# 3. Open it in RStudio.
# 4. Run the code to see two pictures.
# 5. One picture shows hot dogs eaten from 1980 to 2010.
# 6. The other shows job numbers over time.
